</div>

<div>
  <h1>Files</h1>

Up to 500 favorites may be saved. Duplicate favorites with identical name and URL pairs are not allowed.</p>
  
  <h2>Importing Favorites From File</h2>
  <p>To add several favorites at once, you can import them from a favorites file stored on your device. The favorites file must be a .txt file located in the download folder you've set in the "Settings" section. The default download folder is at /sdcard/Downloader.

To import all favorites in a favorite file, select the "Import favorites from file" option in the favorites menu and then select the favorites file from the list shown.</p>
  
  <h2>Importing Favorites From URL</h2>
  <p>To add several favorites at once, you can import them from a URL. The URL used can point to a .txt file stored online or a pastebin.com page. See the "Favorites Import Format" section below for details about the proper format of the contents of the favorites file or pastebin.com text. To import all favorites from a URL, select the "Import favorites from URL" option in the favorites menu and then enter the URL of the favorites file or pastebin.com page.</p>
  
  <h2>Favorites Import Format</h2>
  <p>To properly import favorites, either from a file or from a URL, the list of favorites must have one favorite on each line. Each line must start with the URL to be imported as a favorite. If you want to include an optional name for the favorite, add a space after the URL and then the favorite's name. The favorite's name may contain additional spaces.<br><br>

  For example, this is a properly formated list of favorites:<br><br>
  <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; https://www.google.com Google<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; https://amazon.com Amazon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; https://domain.com Spaces in the name are fine <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://urls-without-names-are-also-fine.com<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.this-is-favorites-url.com This is the favorites name</em><br><br></p>
  
  <h2>Exporting Favorites</h2>
  <p>To save your list of favorites to a .txt file, select the "Export favorites to file" option from the favorites menu. The location of the export file will be displayed and you will be asked to confirm its creation. The favorites export file will be saved in the download folder you've set in the "Settings" section.

  <h2>Editing Favorites</h2>
  <p>To edit an existing favorite, highlight the favorite in the "Favorites" section, press the menu (≡) button on the remote, and select the "Edit favorite" option. You will then be able to modify the name and/or URL of the favorite.</p>
  
  <h2>Deleting Favorites</h2>

You will then be asked to confirm deletion. You can also delete all favorites at once by selecting the "Delete ALL favorites" options from the favorites menu. You will be asked to confirm deletion of all favorites before they are deleted. Deleted favorites cannot be recovered.</p>
  
  <h2>Reordering Favorites</h2>

</div>

<div>
  <h1>Settings</h1>
  <h2>Download Folder</h2>
  <p>Enter the name of the folder in your device's /sdcard directory where you would like files to be downloaded. If a folder with the name you enter does not exist, one will be created. This is also the directory that is displayed in the "Files" section of this app.
	<br>The default value is: Downloader.</p>
  
  <h2>APK Auto-Install</h2>
  <p>If this setting is checked, any APK downloaded by this app will automatically ask to be installed. You can uncheck this option if you prefer to download several files first and then install them all at once from the "Files" section of the app.
  <br>The default value is: Checked.</p>
  
  <h2>Always Open Pages In Browser</h2>
  <p>If this setting is checked, URLs entered on the "Home" screen, which do not point directly to a file, will automatically be opened in the built-in web browser. If this setting is unchecked, you will always be asked if you want to open the URL in the built-in web browser.
  <br>The default value is: Checked.</p>
  
  <h2>Enable JavaScript In Browser</h2>
  <p>If this setting is checked, JavaScript code on websites loaded in the built-in web browser will be allowed to function. If unchecked, all JavaScript code will be blocked. Many websites require JavaScript to work correctly. If you load a website in the built-in web browser and it does not look right or does not work correctly, you can try enabling JavaScript and re-loading the website. Disabling JavaScript often results in websites loading faster, and often prevents website ads from loading altogether. It also prevents potentially malicious code from harming your device.
  <br>The default value is: Unchecked.</p>
</div>

<div>
